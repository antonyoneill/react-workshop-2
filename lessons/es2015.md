# ES2015

Before we dive into more React we're going to take a quick detour into ES2015.

We won't use too many new features but there's a few that we should cover.

Change directory into the `es2015-exercises` folder and run `yarn test` (or `npm test`).

Open `es2015.test.js` in your editor and work through each test one by one. There's comments telling you what to do :)
