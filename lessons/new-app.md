## Using create-react-app

Up until now we have used apps that I'd set up ahead of time for the workshop. However, we're now going to actually create a new application.

To do this you need create-react-app installed: `npm install --global create-react-app`. Alternatively, `yarn global add create-react-app`.

Before we start, make sure none of the apps from earlier today are running!

To generate a new app, you can run:

```
create-react-app my-app
```

For each of these exercises, you should create a new app.

##Â App One

You've been asked to build an application that lets you show profile information from GitHub about a particular username.

The requirements:

- I can visit the page and see a search box that is automatically focused.
- I can search for a GitHub username.
- We make a request to the API to fetch the user's profile information, and display it on the page.
- It should show me an error if the username does not exist.

Instead of the actual GitHub API, you should use my proxy, http://github-proxy-api.herokuapp.com/users/jackfranklin, which will avoid us being rate limited!

## App Two: lists of Github repos

(You can either just use the previous app and keep going, or start a new one).

Requirements:

You can view a list of repos for Github by going to http://github-proxy-api.herokuapp.com/users/jackfranklin/repos.

You can navigate to a particular page by appending `?page=2` to the above URL.

Build an app that lets me browse through my Github repositories, navigating page by page.

You should use React Router to list the repositories and to enable pagination.
